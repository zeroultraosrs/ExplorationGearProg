## Introduction

Ironman mode in Old School RuneScape (OSRS) offers a challenging experience where players are entirely self-sufficient, unable to trade with others. This gear progression chart is designed to guide Ironman players through an optimal path of gear and skill upgrades, enhancing their gameplay and progression.

The chart is interactive, allowing players to track their progress by marking items and skills they've acquired. It provides a visual representation of the recommended order in which to obtain gear and unlocks, helping players plan their journey effectively.

## Features

- **Interactive Tracking**: Click on items and skills to mark them as acquired, which will be saved locally on your browser.
- **Visual Progression Path**: A clear, visual representation of the suggested gear and skill acquisition sequence.
- **Easy to Use**: Simply open the HTML file in your browser to start using the chart.
- **Persistent State**: Your progress is saved locally, so you can return to the chart without losing your tracked items.
- **Tailored for Ironman**: Specifically designed with the Ironman gameplay style in mind.

## Usage

1. **Access the Chart**: Visit [https://madssb.github.io/InteractiveGearProg/index.html](https://madssb.github.io/interactiveGearProg) to use the chart directly in your browser.
2. **Track Progress**: Click on any gear item or skill icon to mark it as acquired. Progress is saved locally in your browser and will persist between visits.
3. **Resetting Progress**: To reset your progress, clear your browser's local storage for this site.

## Local Development
Running the chart locally is useful for offline access or for contributors who want to customize the progression sequence for their own needs. This flexibility allows for tailoring the tool to different game modes or personal preferences.

## For Developers
This project is built with plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with no external dependencies. The chart’s interactivity relies on browser localStorage for tracking user progress. Key scripts include:
- `render-items.js`: Fetches JSON data and renders the chart dynamically.
- `right-clicks.js`: Adds a custom context menu for enhanced interactivity.

### Development Workflow
- Edit the JSON files in `data/` to update the chart’s sequence or items.
- Modify the JavaScript in `scripts/` for new features or bug fixes.
