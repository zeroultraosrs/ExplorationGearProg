    <h2>Legend</h2>
        It is expected that you don't necessarily obtain every item on this route when they appear.
             <span style="color: #FF8469">Red</span> denotes optional items,
             <span style="color: #F5E38C">yellow</span> denotes items you can delay until later,
            and  <span style="color: #A9B6FC">blue</span> denotes long term grinds.
            <br>You can mark items as skipped by right clicking them.</br>
    <h2>Text Version</h2>
        This chart is based on the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JClp-tDfhuf6BGlO_wZxrbwnvWgdHkKwCjmsxkJMfFU">Ironman PvM Exploration Guide</a>.
            Which contains routing for bosses that don't have meaningful gear unlocks, alongside more thorough explanations for overall progression and specific steps.
            It also currently houses the FAQ, as most questions aren't frequent enough to put them on this website.
